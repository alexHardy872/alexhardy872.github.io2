                        <h2>My Story</h2>
                        <p>I originally went to college for Exercise Science to become a personal trainer or strength coach.
                            after graduating, earning my certifications and working for a while I realized that it wasn't really what I wanted to do
                            with my life. </p><br>
                            <p>I used to be very involved in coaching and competeing in the sport of Powerlifting. When I was,
                            fitness and lifting was my passion. So it always seemed like I was working towards doing what i 
                            WANTED to do. But that enthusiasm did not last long once I left the school environment.
                            </p>
                            <p>I became distracted by endevors I was more passionate about and became dissatisfied
                            with the diminishing intellectuall returns of trying to stay financially afloat in the fitness industry.</p><br>
                            <p> I left the field and started working factory jobs. After 2 years working nights
                            in a fermentation plant I finally decided to make a move for a new career.</p>
                        <p>I have always enjoyed creative endeavors from movie making to painting
                            , writing, and many other things. I've also always done well in school
                             and I generally like learning new things. 
                        </p>
                        <p> A friend convinced me that a good career path for me might be to be a software developer.
                            After deciding on computer programming as my new direction I am starting devCode Camo with
                            zero prior coding background so let's hope it goes O.K.!</p>
