                        <h2>My Story</h2>
                        <p>I originally went to college for Exercise Science science to become a personal trainer,
                            after graduating and working for a while I realized that it wasn't really what I wanted to do
                            . So I left the field and started working factory jobs. After 2 years working nights
                            in a fermentation plant I finally decided to make a move for a new career.</p>
                        
                        <p> A friend convinced me that a good career path was to be a software developer.
                            After deciding on computer programming as my new direction I am starting devCode Camo with
                            zero prior coding background so let's hope it goes O.K.!</p>
